**Here are the steps explaining how to record a Google Meet session:**


## 1. Start or join a meeting
The recording feature is only available for certain Google Workspace editions. If you have a personal account, you won’t be able to record. These workspaces include Essentials, Business and Enterprise editions and Education Plus. You can record a Google Meet meeting if you are the organizer or, if a participant, you are from the same organization as the organizer.

## 2. Look for the activities icon
To record your Google Meet session, look to the bottom right of the screen. The Activities button is the icon with a triangle, square and circle. Click it and then Recording.

## 3. Start the recording
Next, click on Start recording. When you’re ready to record the Google Meet call, click on Start. At this time, the meeting particpants will be notified that the recording has begun.

## 4. Stop the recording
To stop recording the meeting, click on Activities > Recording > Stop Recording. When prompted by the pop-up window, click on Stop Recording.

The Google Meet recording will automatically save to the meeting organizer’s My Drive, under the folder Meet Recordings. The organizer and the person who started the meeting, if different, will receive an email with a shareable link to the recording.
